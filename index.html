            <p>Greetings!<br><br> My name is Stacey. I was born and raised in the D.C. area before moving to Cedar Rapids in 2011 to attend Coe College. After graduating from there with my BS in Psychology, I worked full time as a Sign Language Interpreter. Feeling stagnant in my career as well as having my interest piqued by Delta V's program, I decided to leave my career field in pursuit of an education in Software Development. In my free time I'm usually wrangling my 3 year old daughter and 6 year old son, but I also enjoy watching shows like Broad City and The Office, finding unique cocktails, playing board games, or running my small photography business. I also still do some freelance interpreting. <br><br>
            
            </p>
